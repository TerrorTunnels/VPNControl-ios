# VPNControl iOS App

A SwiftUI-based iOS application for controlling a personal AWS-hosted OpenVPN server. This app was created during a sabbatical in Taipei as part of a larger project to build a personal VPN service. The entire codebase was generated with the assistance of AI tools (ChatGPT and Claude).

## Project Overview

VPNControl is designed to work with a custom AWS infrastructure that includes:
- An EC2 instance running OpenVPN
- API Gateway and Lambda for server control
- Infrastructure defined with Terraform

The app provides a simple interface to:
- Start and stop your VPN instance
- Monitor VPN status in real-time
- Securely store API credentials

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 16.0 or later
- An AWS infrastructure set up with:
  - API Gateway endpoint
  - API Key for authentication
  - Lambda function for EC2 control
  - EC2 instance configured with OpenVPN

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rjamestaylor/VPNControl.git
```

2. Create a new Xcode project:
   - Create a new iOS app project in Xcode
   - Choose "SwiftUI App" as the interface
   - Set minimum deployment target to iOS 16.0
   - Add the Swift files from this repository to your project

3. Configure the API endpoint:
   - Open `VPNApiClient.swift`
   - Replace the `baseURL` with your API Gateway URL:
```swift
private let baseURL = "https://your-api-gateway-url.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod"
```

4. Build and run the project in Xcode

### API Key Configuration

The app requires an API key for authentication. Once you have your API key from AWS:
1. Launch the app
2. Go to Settings
3. Enter your API key
4. The key will be securely stored in the iOS Keychain

## üì± App Architecture

### MVVM Architecture
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:
- **Models**: `VPNState`, `StatusInfo`
- **Views**: `ContentView`, `StatusCardView`, `SettingsView`
- **ViewModels**: `VPNViewModel`, `AppSettings`

### Key Components

#### Views
- `ContentView.swift`: Main interface with VPN controls
- `StatusCardView.swift`: Visual representation of VPN status
- `SettingsView.swift`: API key management

#### View Models
- `VPNViewModel.swift`: Manages VPN state and API interactions
- `AppSettings.swift`: Handles app configuration and API key storage

#### Networking
- `VPNApiClient.swift`: API client for VPN control endpoints
- Implements async/await for network calls
- Handles API authentication and error cases

#### Security
- `KeychainManager.swift`: Secure storage for API credentials
- Implements best practices for iOS keychain usage

## üîí Security Features

- API keys stored securely in iOS Keychain
- HTTPS for all API communications
- AWS API Gateway authentication
- No VPN credentials stored in the app

## üõ† Technical Details

### Networking
The app uses URLSession with async/await for API calls:
```swift
func getStatus() async throws -> [String: Any] {
    guard let url = URL(string: "\(baseURL)/vpn/status") else {
        throw VPNError.invalidURL
    }
    
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "GET"
    request.setValue(apiKey, forHTTPHeaderField: "x-api-key")
    
    let (data, response) = try await session.data(for: request)
    // ... response handling
}
```

### State Management
VPN state is managed through a state enum with associated UI properties:
```swift
enum VPNState: String, Codable {
    case running
    case stopped
    case starting
    case stopping
    
    var isTransitioning: Bool {
        self == .starting || self == .stopping
    }
}
```

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for network and keychain operations:
```swift
enum VPNError: Error {
    case invalidURL
    case networkError(Error)
    case invalidResponse
    case decodingError
}
```

## ü§ñ AI Development

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted development. The entire codebase was generated through conversations with AI tools, with human oversight for:
- Architecture decisions
- Security considerations
- UI/UX choices
- Integration points

## üìù Requirements for AWS Infrastructure

The app expects these API endpoints:
- POST `/vpn` - Start/Stop VPN instance
- GET `/vpn/status` - Get VPN status

API requests must include:
- `x-api-key` header for authentication
- JSON body for POST requests
- Query parameters for GET requests
